                        It's positioned relative to itself, meaning the offset is applied from where the element would be if it were static.</td>

                    <td>This is a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning.
                        The element behaves like a relatively positioned element until it reaches a specified threshold (using top, right, bottom, or left), at which point it becomes fixed.
                        It's useful for creating elements that stick to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down, such as a sticky header.</td>
